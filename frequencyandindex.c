// Given an integer array, sort its element by their frequency and index. 
// i.e., if two elements have different frequencies, then the one which has more frequency should come first; 
// otherwise, the one which has less index should come first.

// For example
// Input : [3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8, 7, 8]
 
// Output: [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 6, 7]


// create an auxilliary array
